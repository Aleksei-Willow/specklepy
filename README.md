## Introduction

> âš  This is the start of the Python client for Speckle 2.0. It is currently quite nebulous and may be trashed and rebuilt at any moment! It is compatible with Python 3.6+ âš 

## Developing & Debugging

To get started, create a virtual environment and pip install the requirements. 

on windows:
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Overview of functionality 

The `SpeckleClient` is the entry point for interacting with the GraphQL API. You'll need to have a running server to use this.

```py
from speckle.api.client import SpeckleClient
from speckle.api.credentials import get_default_account, get_local_accounts

all_accounts = get_local_accounts() # get back a list
account = get_default_account()

client = SpeckleClient(host="localhost:3000", use_ssl=False)
# client = SpeckleClinet(host="yourserver.com") or whatever your host is

client.authenticate(account.token)
```

Interacting with streams is meant to be intuitive and evocative of PySpeckle 1.0

```py
# get your streams
stream_list = client.stream.list()

# search your streams
results = client.user.search("mech")

# create a stream
new_stream_id = client.stream.create(name="a shiny new stream")

# get a stream
new_stream = client.stream.get(id=new_stream_id)
```

New in 2.0: commits! Here are some basic commit interactions.

```py
# get list of commits
commits = client.commit.get_list("stream id here")

# get a specific commit
commit = client.commit.get("stream id", "commit id")

# create a commit
commit_id = client.commit.create("stream id", "object id", "this is a commit message to describe the commit")

# delete a commit
deleted = client.commit.delete("stream id", "commit id")
```

The `BaseObjectSerializer` is used for decomposing and serializing `Base` objects so they can be sent / received to the server. You can use it directly to get the id (hash) and a serializable object representation of the decomposed `Base`.

```py
detached_base = Base()
detached_base.name = "this will get detached"

base_obj = Base()
base_obj.name = "my base"
base_obj["@nested"] = detached_base

serializer = BaseObjectSerializer()
hash, obj_dict = serializer.traverse_base(base_obj)
```

If you use the `operations`, you will not need to interact with the serializer directly as this will be taken care of for you. You will just need to provide a transport to indicate where the objects should be sent / received from. At the moment, just the `MemoryTransport` is fully functional.

```py
transport = MemoryTransport()

# this serialises the object and sends it to the transport 
hash = operations.send(base=base_obj, transports=[transport])

# if the object had detached objects, you can see these as well
saved_objects = transport.objects # a dict with the obj hash as the key

# this receives and object from the given transport, deserialises it, and recomposes it into a base object
received_base = operations.receive(obj_id=hash, remote_transport=transport)
```

You can also use the GraphQL API to send and receive objects.

```py
# create a test base object
test_base = Base()
test_base.testing = "a test base obj"

# run it through the serialiser
s = BaseObjectSerializer() 
hash, obj = s.traverse_base(test_base)

# send it to the server
objCreate = client.object.create(stream_id="stream id", objects=[obj])

received_base = client.object.get(hash)
```
